Total learning sample size is 245057; out of which 50859 is the skin samples and 194198 is non-skin samples. Color FERET Image Database: [Web Link], PAL Face Database from Productive Aging Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas: [Web Link]. \r\n\r\nAttribute Information:\r\nThis dataset is of the dimension 245057 * 4 where first three columns are B,G,R (x1,x2, and x3 features) values and fourth column is of the class labels (decision variable y).\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\nrun the sourcefile skin_segmentation.m using matlab or octave.\r\nto change the inputs/testset data modify values in in.txt. It consists of four columns where the first column is a 1 and the rest correspond to B, G and R values respectively. Once you run, after training the algorithm computes a probability between 0 and 1 which the probablity of the given pixels being a skin.\r\ni.e. p(y=1|B, G, R)\r\n\r\nLogistic regression was used to classify the dataset.\r\nTraining set Accuracy without regularization : 91.89\r\nTraining set Accuracy with regularization(regularization parameter lambda=0.5): 91.92\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nRajen Bhatt, Abhinav Dhall, 'Skin Segmentation Dataset', UCI Machine Learning Repository\r\nMachine Learning by Andrew Ng at Coursera\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
